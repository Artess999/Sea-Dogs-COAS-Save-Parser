# Sea Dogs COAS Save Parser

## Requirements

In order to run this script you need:

- NodeJs
- Installed dependencies
- Some save files from a storm game (TEHO, COAS, ...)

## How to
To run the script, just type in the console
``node index.js {filepath}``

E.g. ``node index.js "C:\save"``

Results will be saved in util folder in 'result-json.txt'

## Issues

I've tested this parser only on Maelstrom fork, guess it'll work with other versions of Storm Engine
